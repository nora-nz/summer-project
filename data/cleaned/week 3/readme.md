Cleaned data from hsa05415.xml:

- export_hsa05415.json - entry names, id, x & y coordinates and types
- relations_export_hs05415.json - relationship arrows starts and ends
- d3_data.json - specific data required by d3 (divided into nodes and links(edges), nodes have "name", "type" and "id" attributes, links have "source", "target" and "value" attributes. I'm planning to use the "value" attribute as a measure of flux change later on.
